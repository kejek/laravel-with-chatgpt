# Workcation 2023 Hackathon

Let’s build a prototype! In the AI working group an idea for helping users understand letters they receive related to business compliance tasks. For example, perhaps a user received a letter from the IRS. Let’s focus on a slice of this problem domain and see if we can find creative an interesting solutions.

A first step in being able to process this information is extracting it from an uploaded image. For this hackathon, create an entry that uses some kind of technology (like OCR) to do this extraction. That’s the core mission.

In true hackathon fashion, we want folks to dream up big and interesting ideas. Bonus points will be considered for entries that find additional ways of making this document more useful. For example, it may be helpful to identify the address block on formal letters. Kick your creative side into high gear and see what ideas you can explore to enhance the core ask.

## The BDD explainer of the core ask

**Given** an image of a letter the user has uploaded

**And** the letter is from the IRS

**Then** the plain-text representation of the letter contents should be output

## Submitting

This repo! Teams should create a branch and publish to this repo. Feel free to iterate here if thats your style. Just get the code into this repo with a branch name that you will remember. **Don't merge your branch to main**.

## Rules

- Use any tech stack you want, not limited to our core stuff (yes, Rust is allowable)
- Pair off in teams of two (three max, but please try for two)
- Take a risk! Try something new! Have fun (optional)!
